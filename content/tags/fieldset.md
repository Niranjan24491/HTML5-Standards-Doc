The fieldset tag specifies a set of form fields. It is generally used to group logically related controls and labels within a web form. Grouping form controls makes it easier for users to understand their purpose and makes the documents more accessible.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
The HTML elements fieldset allow you to layout and organise a large form with many different areas of interest in a logical way without using tables. The fieldset tag can be used to create boxes around selected elements. In this way form elements can be grouped together into identified categories.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>fieldset are allow you to mark up your data in the most semantic way available.</li>
  <li>It's a similar principle to many of the new HTML5 tagsets. <footer> for example tells you more about the meaning of the data inside it compared to an ambiguous.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

      <legend>Colour</legend>
      <label><input type="radio" name="colour" value="blue"> Blue </label>
      <label><input type="radio" name="colour" value="red"> Red </label>
