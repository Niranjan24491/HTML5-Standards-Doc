<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
The HTML hr element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section). In previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, but is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
This tag is needed if we need to separate the documents sections with a horizontal line.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Better presentational view for differentiating two or more document sections.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Disadvantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The separation can be done with CSS and recommended to do so.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <p>This is the first paragraph of text.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is second paragraph of text.</p>
