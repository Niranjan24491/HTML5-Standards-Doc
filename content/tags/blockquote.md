The HTML <span class='tag-span'>&lt;blockquote&gt;</span> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <span class='tag-span'>&lt;cite&gt;</span> element.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes "cite" to mention URL that designates a source document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  To change <blockquote> indent, use CSS margin property.

  For short quotes use <q> element.

  <h3>See also</h3>
